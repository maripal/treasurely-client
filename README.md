# Treasurely

I decided to create an app to track savings, but with a twist. I wanted to have something to track my savings for things that I want to buy, whether I need or just want it.
So I came up with _Treasurely_. I'm able to not only track my savings, but also track of items I want, kind of like a wishlist.
You can list anything you want, from a book, to a trip, or whatever you want.
